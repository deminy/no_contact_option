After you have core module 'contact' installed, option 'Contact settings' is always displayed on user 
edit page even you have permission "Use users' personal contact forms" inactivated. By enabling 
this module, you can have that option permanently removed from user edit page.

In a word, this model does one thing only: remove option 'Contact settings' completely from user 
edit page. This is a D7-only module, and there is no any configuration options for this module.

This is inspirited from an unofficial Drupal 6 module 'x_contact_option' proposed by Matt B, which
can be found here: http://drupal.org/node/138574#comment-928203 . However, in Drupal 7, things are
a little different comparing to Drupal 6.
